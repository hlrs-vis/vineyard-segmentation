# Vineyard-segmentation
Automatic segmentation by cultivation status of vineyards.

## About The Project
This program is built on the Keras framework and uses drone imagery of vineyards to train a U-Net model for automatically identifying the status of farmland. It can detect various conditions, such as cultivated vineyards, abandoned fields, large-scale landslides, and more.
